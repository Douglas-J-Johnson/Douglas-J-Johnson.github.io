            <h1>Hello, my name is <em>Doug Johnson</em>.  Thank you for coming to visit!</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Colorado native, husband, and father of two.  And then father of two more... dogs.
                I have spent the majority of my career in tech as a systems engineer, mainly in the realm 
                of software development, with some experience in operations.  I participated in many aspects
                of the software development lifecycle.  I love solving problems and creating solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to moving into a new phase of my career as software developer, systems engineer,
                or any combination thereof with my new software development skills!  Take a minute to look 
                around and see my projects and profiles and then reach out to me!
            </p>
