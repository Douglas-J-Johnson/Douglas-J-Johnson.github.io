        <h1>Hello, my name is <em>Doug Johnson</em>.  Thank you for coming to visit!</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Colorado native, husband, and father of two.  And then father of two more... dogs.
            I have spent the majority of my career in tech as a systems engineer, mainly in the realm 
            of software development, with some experience in operations.  I participated in many aspects
            of the software development lifecycle.  I love solving problems and creating solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am excited to moving into a new phase of my career as software developer, systems engineer,
            or any combination thereof with my new software development skills!  Take a minute to look 
            around an see my projects and profiles and then reach out to me!
        </p>
        <h2>
            Thanks,
            Doug
        </h2>
